Interestingly, Dr. Levinson wrote his doctoral thesis on 'The Art of Deciphering Puzzles' at the prestigious Harvard University, renowned in the field of cryptography. His work generally revolves around decoding encrypted war messages. During his research, he came across ancient texts and manuscripts full of unsolved riddles that inspired him to weave his career around decoding.

However, it's important to note that the years of research and professional background of Dr. Levinson in cryptography and related fields don't contribute directly to the answer of this riddle. The puzzle itself carries the answer within its structure and wording. So although knowing the researcher helps understand the context, it merely serves as an interesting bit of history and does not aid in solving the riddle itself.
