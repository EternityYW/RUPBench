"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?","['A)5(√3 + 1)' 'B)6(√3 + √2)' 'C)7(√3 – 1)' 'D)8(√3 – 2)'
 'E)None of these']","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

"Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?",['A)15' 'B)16' 'C)17' 'D)18' 'E)19'],"Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm.

Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years.

Since the population two years from now (121) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121/2=60.5.
Now, the question asks about the population increase over the last year, so from 60.5 (last year) to 100 (now): percent increase=difference/original*100=(100-60.5)/60.5*100=39.5/60.5*100=~2/3*100=~65%.

abc – cba + 396c = 990
100a + 10b + c – (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a – 99c + 396c = 990
Observe that each term is divisible by 99. So on dividing the above expression by 99, we get
a – c + 4c = 10
a + 3c = 10
For c = 1, a = 7
c = 2, a = 4
c = 3, a = 1
'b' can take any value from 0 to 9
We have to find the value of M more than 300. So minimum value of 'a' should be 4.
So total possibilities are 402, 412, ...., 492 = 10 values

The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

70 T + 30 S = 810
Simplifying we get : 7T + 3S = 81
T = ( 81 - 3*S )/7
We need to find the least value of S which will make (81 - 3*S) divisible by 7
Simplifying by taking 3 as common factor 3*(27-S) / 7
Looking at the above equation its not difficult to find out least value of S is 6 so that 27- 3S becomes divisible by S
Hence, T = (81-3*S)/7 = (81-3*6)/7 = 63/7 = 9

"A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100. What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount?",['A)247.67' 'B)237.67' 'C)227.67' 'D)215.67' 'E)None of these'],"Explanation:
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4% of $20 000 = $800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice. He needs to borrow $20 000 = $800 = $19 200. He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 (the day the original invoice is due) resulting in a 70-day loan. The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $800.
r=I/pt=21.73%
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73%. This is a break-even rate. If he can borrow money, say at a rate of 15%, he should do so. He would borrow $19 200 for 70 days at 15%. Maturity value of the loan is $19 200(1+0.15(70/365))=$19 752.33
savings would be $20 000 − $19 752.33 = $247.67

A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing.

What is the manufactured cost of each pen?,['A)Rs. 6' 'B)Rs. 7.2' 'C)Rs. 5.6' 'D)Rs. 8' 'E)None of these'],"The company is able to deliver 90% of the manufactured pens. Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10% are defectives. So, let K be the manufacturing price of each pen.
Total income (including 25% profit) = 8000 *K *1.25
This same income is obtained by selling 90% manufactured pens at Rs. 10 which is equal to 7200 *10.
Thus,
8000 *K *1.25 = 7200 *10
K = Rs. 7.2. [90% of 8000 = 7200]

So volume of coin T= pi r^2 h = pi (7.5)^2 * 2
Coin=Silver+Aluminum
Now total volume of coin(T) = volume of silver + volume of aluminum
Also, volume of silver(Vs)= volume of aluminum(Va)
T= Va+Vb
T=2Va
Va=T/2= pi (7.5)^2 * 2 /2 = pi (7.5)^2
Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.
Let the weight of aluminum in coin be x
Weight of Silver = 2x
Total weight of coin = 30
x+2x=30
x=10
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10gm
Wright of Silver in coin is 20gm.
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10gm and volume is pi (7.5)^2
Now new Aluminum coin is made with dimension 1x30mm.
Volume of this new coin = pi (15)^2*1.
Volume of pi (7.5)^2 contains weight of 10 gm of aluminum

"Two trains under a controlled experiment begin at a speed of 100 mph in the opposite direction in a tunnel. A supersonic bee is left in the tunnel which can fly at a speed of 1000 mph. The tunnel is 200 miles long. When the trains start running on a constant speed of 100 mph, the supersonic bee starts flying from one train towards the other. As soon as the bee reaches the second train, it starts flying back towards the first train.

A typical way will be to start thinking about summing up the distance that the bee will travel but that will be quite a tedious task. How about we offer you a much easy solution?
The tunnel is 200 miles long and the trains are running at as peed of 100 mph which means that they will collide exactly at the center of the tunnel and seeking their speed, they will collide after an hour.
Now consider the bee which is flying at a speed of 1000 mph and will keep flying till the train collides. As calculated, it will keep flying for an hour which means the distance that it will cover is 1000 miles.

He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?",['A)1249' 'B)1246' 'C)1202' 'D)1000' 'E)None of these'],"Explanation :
Let, each equal part is x and N be the total number of biscuits.
Thus, N=5x+1.
A took (x+1) biscuit.
Now 4x is of the form 5y+1 then x must be in the form 5z+4
⇒4(5z+4)=5y+1
⇒y=4z+3 and x=5z+4
The ratio of number of biscuits that A and B took is
[(5z+4)+1]:[(4z+3)+1]=5:4.
So, we can say that any two successive persons A, B, C and D take coins in the ratio of 5:4
Let the number of biscuits that A, B, C and D took be a, b, c and d respectively.
=>a:b=b:c=c:d=5:4.
=>a:b:c:d=125:100:80:64.
=>a=125k.
=>x=125k−1 and N=5x+1=625k−4.
As, N>1000, the least value of N is when k=2.
=>N= 1246.

17 min
The initial solution most people will think of is to use the fastest person as an usher to guide everyone across. How long would that take? 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 minutes. Is that it? No. That would make this question too simple even as a warm up question.
Let's brainstorm a little further. To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together. If they cross together, then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. Ahaa, we are getting closer. The fastest way to get 1 across and be back is to use 2 to usher 1 across. So let's put all this together.
1 and 2 go cross
2 comes back
7 and 10 go across
1 comes back
1 and 2 go across (done)

addition of any of these two 2-digit prime numbers cannot be greater than or equal to 30,
which places a strong restriction on the greatest of the three numbers: this must be at most
19. These are the only valid additions of any two numbers on that set:
11 + 11 = 22, 11 + 13 = 24, 11 + 17 = 29, 11 + 19 = 30, 13 + 13 = 26, 13 + 17 = 30
Note in particular the strict inequalities placed on the addition of any of these two numbers:
22 _<A + C < B + C < A + B _<30
Since C < B, there are only two possibilities for B+C at this point: B = 13,C = 11,B+C =

"When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. When Lisa joins Mary, and they work together, it takes them only 3 hours to paint a house of the same size. How long would it take for Lisa to paint a house of the same size by herself?",['A)5 hr' 'B)6 hr' 'C)7 hr' 'D)12 hr' 'E)20 hr'],"Here, the rate equation becomes:
(# of houses) = (painting rate) x (time)
When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. Thus, (1 house) = (Mary’s rate) x (4 hr), so her rate is 1/4.
When Mary & Lisa paint together, it takes 3 hrs. Thus, (1 house) = (combined rate) x (3 hr) and the combined rate = 1/3.
To find a combined rate, we add individual rates.
(combined rate) = (Mary’s rate) + (Lisa’s rate)
1/3 = 1/4 + (Lisa’s rate)
(Lisa’s rate) = 1/3-1/4=1/3*4/4-1/4*3/3=4/12-3/12=1/12
Lisa’s rate is 1/12 of a house every hour, or in other words, 1 house in 12 hrs. Thus, it would take her 12 hours to paint a house of the same size.
